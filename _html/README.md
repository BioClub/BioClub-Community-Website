HTML/CSS Design Files

### These files are out of date 
### TODO: Update the design files

- Design Tests in HTML
- ~~Please use the [Tachyons CSS Framework](http://tachyons.io) `css/tachyons.min.css` for CSS prototyping~~
- New Designs use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), if you want to contribute design, please also use that framework. Tailwind requires a [little bit of setup](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to get going.
