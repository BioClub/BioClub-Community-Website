# BioClub Tokyo Community Website

Public Development for the  BioClub Tokyo Community Website. Theme for [BioClub Tokyo](http://www.bioclub.tokyo).

The [old BioClub](http://bioclub.org) Website at is a bit chaotic, it does not really reflect all the projects, events and experiments happening at BioClub.

Unfortunately it's not possible for the BioClub community to change/update the CMS and structure of the server, therefore we decided to make a new website - where we can implement the needs and requirements of the community.

The website and it's theme should also be free and open-source.

# Discussion & Content

- What do you want from the site?
- What is still missing?
- What is needed to run the BioClub?

Please write your ideas, suggestions and proposed content in the [Shared Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o2WTNjTxkZYKmCmdziS-a4XgKwddnrclsKorgtMeCUo/edit?usp=sharing)

## Option 2: ProcessWire (currently evaluating)
