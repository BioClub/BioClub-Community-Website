# BioClub Tokyo Community Website

Public Development for the  BioClub Tokyo Community Website. Theme for [BioClub Tokyo](http://www.bioclub.tokyo).

The [old BioClub](bioclub.org) Website at is a bit chaotic, it does not really reflect all the projects, events and experiments happening at BioClub.

Unfortunately it's not possible for the BioClub community to change/update the CMS and structure of the server, therefore we decided to make a new website - where we can implement the needs and requirements of the community.

The website and it's theme should also be free and open-source. Some members of the BioClub Community have experience and expertise in [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org), so let's build upon that!

# Discussion

What do you want from the site? What is still missing? What is needed to run the BioClub? Please write your ideas/suggestions at the [Wiki](https://github.com/BioClub/BioClub-Wordpress-Theme/wiki).

There is also a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o2WTNjTxkZYKmCmdziS-a4XgKwddnrclsKorgtMeCUo/edit?usp=sharing) for easily sharing the ideas.

# Structure

# Designer

Here is also a shared [Figma Project](https://www.figma.com/file/UlvsISNrw5YMwFB7B3MuC6/BioClub-Tokyo---Website?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=hWTEsAzRiLPzzu5x-1) where we can jointly develop the Design for the Website.
